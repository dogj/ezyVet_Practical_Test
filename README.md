addtional:
if landline is a mobile and mobile or other is empty, it will tranferred to a mobile or other

Birthday also have problem, some only have two digits for year, I consider this probaly some kind of old data and add 19XX for that
that might be wrong, because there might be some one born at 20XX

my laptop is an Chinese laptop so I have to use charset="utf8mb4"

data sample is too small, probaly will have other problem during ETL, wrong data will be printed
